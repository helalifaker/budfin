## 9. Residual Risks

1. **Viewer mode not visually tested** — V7 was not exercised via browser automation. Code review confirms all inputs check `isReadOnly` prop, and the `viewer.epic7@efir.edu.sa` user exists. Low risk.
2. **Prior-year data depends on FiscalPeriod linkage** — If no `FiscalPeriod` records have `actualVersionId` set, prior-year column shows dashes. This is expected behavior, not a bug.
3. **"Recommended workflow" cards in inspector** still reference "Reconcile tariff assignment against enrollment" — this is pre-existing text from the workflow guidance module and is not part of this remediation scope.
